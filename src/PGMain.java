/**
 * APCS_P4_PuzzleGame
 * Name: Abhay Varshney, Joshua Cheung, Sasan Erfan  Period 4   3/23/16
 * Time Spent: ~10hrs
 * Reflection: Overall this lab was very fun because it was entirely a group project. We got to work
 *             as a team and communicate the issues that we had as a team. I enjoyed using Github
 *             because that is what is going to be used in the real world. Using terminal and
 *             dealing with merge conflicts was fun as well. This game is mostly like the Sokoban game
 *             online. We just converted it to pure java, and we had to think of the logic
 *             by ourselves. We didn't really run into huge problems in this lab. It was just time-consuming
 *             because we had a lot of components and logic to add.
